To use the Parallel Coordinate Plot generator, open a .csv file using the file input, 
and click the load button. The program will parse the input, and display a parallel coordinate
plot of the data. By default, only the first 5 fields will be mapped to axes and displayed in 
the output, and the color mapping is "None".

Expand any of the control panels on the left by clicking on them. 
In the "Display Axis" panel, check the boxes to choose which axes to display in the plot. 
In the "Groups" panel, choose which grouping to use to map color to the data.
In the "Legend" panel, see which colors are mapped to which sets, and choose which sets to highlight.

The plot currently supports interaction only in the form of brushing. Click and drag on an axis
to select only records that fall within that range on the axis.

Sample datasets are included in the "datasets" folder.
