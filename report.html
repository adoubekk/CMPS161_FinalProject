                  <p> Final project for CMPS 161: Introduction to Data Visualization, Winter 2017. </p>
                     
                  <p>  Abstract: The unusually large applicant pool to the Computer Science graduate program
                     at UCSC in 2017 introduced a problem of scale to the admissions process.
                     By applying multivariate visualization techniques to applicants' admission data,
                     I aim to identify correlations in the data that could be applicable to the selection
                     process in the future. I employ a common information visualization technique known
                     as the parallel coordinate plot. A brief overview of this technique is provided,
                     as well as descriptions of several common methods to improve its readability and
                     usefulness that are implemented in this project.

                  This project was implemented with <a href = "https://d3js.org/">d3.js</a>, using modules 
                  d3-axis, d3-scale, d3-brush, and d3-shape.

                  <p>   To use the Parallel Coordinate Plot generator, open a .csv file using the file input, 
                  and click the load button. The program will parse the input, and display a parallel coordinate
                  plot of the data. By default, only the first 5 fields will be mapped to axes and displayed in 
                  the output, and the color mapping is "None". </p>

                  <p>Expand any of the control panels on the left by clicking on them. 
                  In the "Display Axis" panel, check the boxes to choose which axes to display in the plot. 
                  In the "Groups" panel, choose which grouping to use to map color to the data.
                  In the "Legend" panel, see which colors are mapped to which sets, and choose which sets to highlight. </p>

                  <p> The plot currently supports interaction only in the form of brushing. Click and drag on an axis
                  to select only records that fall within that range on the axis. </p>

                  <p> Sample datasets are included in the "datasets" folder. </p>
